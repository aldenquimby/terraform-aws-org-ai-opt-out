## Requirements

- AWS providers >= 4.0
- Terraform >= 1.5
- Linux Shell
- Permissions to modify an AWS Organization in a root account

## Usage

- Add a reference to the module in your project

```hcl
module "org_ai_opt_out" {
  source  = "davidjeddy/overmind/aws"
  version = "0.1.0"

  organization = {
    name = var.name
    id   = var.aws_acct_id
  }
}
```

- Execute `plan` to review the changes

```sh
...
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.org_ai_opt_out.aws_organizations_policy.this will be created
  + resource "aws_organizations_policy" "this" {
      + arn         = (known after apply)
      + description = "Opt out of all Amazon AI services at an organization level"
      + id          = (known after apply)
      + name        = "OptOutOfAllAIServicesPolicy"
      + type        = "AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY"
    }

  # module.org_ai_opt_out.aws_organizations_policy_attachment.this will be created
  + resource "aws_organizations_policy_attachment" "this" {
      + id        = (known after apply)
      + policy_id = (known after apply)
      + target_id = "REDACTED"
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

```

- Execute `apply` to deploy the resources
