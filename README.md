## Description

Unless explicitly opted out, data feed through AWS's AI services is used to train AWS ML models. This module disables all available AI/ML data collection. In response to [How to Stop Feeding AWSâ€™s AI With Your Data BY COREY QUINN](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/How-to-Stop-Feeding-AWSs-AI-With-Your-Data/).

## Requirements

Infra tools:

- AWS providers ~ 5
- Terraform ~ 1.6 || OpenToFu ~ 1.6
- Permissions to modify an AWS Organization in a root account

And because the AWS provider is missing the ability to interact with Org policy enablement:

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) ~ 2
- [Bash](https://gnu.org/software/bash/) ~ 5 (or similar Linux shell)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) ~ 1.6

## Usage

- Add a reference to the module in your project

```hcl
module "org_ai_opt_out" {
  source  = "davidjeddy/overmind/aws"
  version = "0.1.0"

  organization = {
    name = var.name
    id   = var.aws_acct_id
  }
}
```

- Execute `plan` to review the changes

```sh
...
      + id          = (known after apply)
      + name        = "OptOutOfAllAIServicesPolicy"
      + tags_all    = {
          + "Contact" = "me@davidjeddy.com"
          + "Owner"   = "David J Eddy"
          + "Version" = "0.0.1"
        }
      + type        = "AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY"
    }

  # module.org_ai_opt_out.aws_organizations_policy_attachment.this will be created
  + resource "aws_organizations_policy_attachment" "this" {
      + id        = (known after apply)
      + policy_id = (known after apply)
      + target_id = "138402329854"
    }

  # module.org_ai_opt_out.terraform_data.this will be created
  + resource "terraform_data" "this" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }
...
```

- Execute `apply` to deploy the resources

```sh
...
module.org_ai_opt_out.terraform_data.this: Creation complete after 8s [id=2fe3ef28-f504-9f1c-0c0e-d07ef71660fa]
